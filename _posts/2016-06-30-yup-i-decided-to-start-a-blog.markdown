I have the thought to start a blog for a few days and finally get to do it today. I heard about setting up a personal blog with GitHub pages before, but I didn't use Git actively then and wasn't thinking of it. I remembered there was a little bit of configuration in order to set things up, but just now I googled some websites that take care of the whole thing and basically I'm just clicking Create. So yeah, here it is.
